// There seems to be an issue with the sass-loader and prefixing
// aliased directories with a tilde. The following line is how
// this import should look and works for node_modules.
// @import '~lib/test-pkg';

// Importing without the tilde seems to work for webpack aliases
@import 'lib/test-pkg';
